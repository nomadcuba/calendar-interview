Is my personal aproach not what he try to do in the video.
- My solution is based on get free time of both person inside de available time to make the meet.
- This free time must be equal or greater than the duration of the meet. (30 minutes in this case)
- Once you get the free time of both persons you must get they intersections
- If the intersection is equal or greater than the duration of the meet then you get that "intersection" as a valid time for meet both persons.
